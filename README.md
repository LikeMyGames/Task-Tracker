# Task Manager
## Overview
This is a program that I built to help manage my tasks (a todo list essentially)<br>
This program has three layers
> 1. HTML, CSS, JS frontend<br>
> 2. GO HTTP server layer<br>
> 3. GO program layer<br>

The GO program layer is what actually does all of the logic of changing lists, saving/opening files, and anything else.<br>
The GO HTTP server layer acts as an interpreter layer between the frontend's requests and the program layer's responses.<br>
The HTML, CSS, and JS frontend is a more user-friendly way of interacting with the program.<br>

## Website Frontend
This is built off of HTML, CSS, and JS.<br>
All of these languages combined create a user-friendly GUI that is easy to navigate and interact with.
> ### List Menu:
> This is where all of the lists can be found and new lists can be created
